    <h1 style = "font-family: 'Poiret One'; color:white">UX Heuristic Analysis - Slack</h1>
  <p style = "font-family: 'Poiret One'; color:white; padding-bottom: 30px;">One of my assignments for SI 110 was to do a design analysis of a website, mobile 	application, 
    or social media platform with respect to Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics for User Experience Design. 
    I chose to review the desktop version of Slack. 
    As the  pandemic necessitated heavy Slack use, I had curated noticed some inadequacies in
     its interface and was eager to showcase what I’d learned thus far in the class. 
     My main complaint was that it lacked a “landing page” for the user, as it instead constantly 
     forces the user to be in one of their workspaces. In other words, 
     there are no spaces for the user to have a high-level overview of their 
     groups or for them to “crash land” should they lose their place in the application’s interface.
      Among my other concerns were that some of the icons don’t represent what you would conventionally expect them to, 
      the tendency for the screen to get cluttered with information, and that Slack seemed to cater towards power 
      users rather than the average person.</p>
