  <p style="color: white;"> One of my first classes at the University of Michigan was History 195, 
    a writing  class that examined global humanitarianism in
     the modern era. Among the required  
     readings was Anand Giridharadas’ <i>Winners Take All: 
     The Elite Charade of Changing the World</i>i, which 
     explained that there exists a tendency in 
     some humanitarian organizations/charities to 
     keep as many resources in their own hands as possible, 
     rather than using them to create meaningful change for 
     the people whom they had promised to serve. 
     In short, these entities would intentionally do ineffectual or self-serving
      work to perpetuate the plight of the needy so that they could continue to profit off of them. 
      <br>
      <br>

      Discerning between organizations that follow through on their promises and 
    those that don’t is a difficult task, so when a couple of friends and 
    I were assigned a project where we were supposed to solve an issue, 
    this seemed like a natural fit. Our solution was to create an app (Chlarity) 
    that would allow organizations that DO honor their promises to more 
    intricately display where their funding goes. 
    That way, they could build consumer trust and promote their brand. 
    Organizations would sign on as partners, and then get direct access to 
    their target audience as well as other organizations for collaboration.
    <br>
    <br>
    The purpose of having this on my website is that I believe that it was a good exercise in
     prototyping, identifying user pain points, and collaborating to decide what product features
     desirable and technically feasible.
