I'm Adam Mentzer, a junior studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan. As someone who stutters, I constantly reflect on ways to make the content of my speech smoother, more fluid, and more easily understood. Perhaps this tendency is the reason I strive to use data-driven approaches to help make products truly conform to the user's needs and that provide tangible value.

      As a student at the University of Michigan, I've learned how to analyze problems and find their solutions, but the most important lessons I've learned are from those who I work with, as the most valuable part of being at Michigan is the empowering opportunity to draw on the knowledge and experiences of others so that I can create as much authentic impact as possible.
      
      Currently, I'm pursuing Information and Computer Science through UM's School of Information, and will hopefully be adding a Business minor through the Ross School of Business this fall.
      
      In my spare time, I love watch to the NFL and Formula 1, while the rest of my weekends are usually spent record shopping with my friends and exploring Ann Arbor through long bike rides -- if you're in the area and need to know where to find the best parks, shop, or eat, I'm your guy.
